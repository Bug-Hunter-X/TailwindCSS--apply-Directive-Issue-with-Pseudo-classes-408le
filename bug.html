This error occurs when using Tailwind's `@apply` directive with a pseudo-class selector that isn't directly supported by Tailwind's base styles.  For example, trying to apply styles for `&:hover` within a component's base styles may result in unexpected behavior, as the `&:hover` state is applied to the component itself, not its child elements as intended.  This can lead to the styles being applied incorrectly or not at all.
