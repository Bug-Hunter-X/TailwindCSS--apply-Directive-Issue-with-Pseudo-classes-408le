To resolve this issue, instead of using `@apply` directly with a pseudo-class in the parent element, apply the class to the child element and then style the child element's hover state. This ensures that the hover styles are applied correctly.

```html
<div class="bg-gray-200 p-4">
  <button class="hover:bg-blue-500 hover:text-white p-2">
    Hover Me
  </button>
</div>
```
In this corrected example, the `hover:bg-blue-500` and `hover:text-white` classes are applied directly to the button element, resulting in the expected hover effect on the button itself, not the parent div.
